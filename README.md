## Getting Started

Welcome to IT101-2L Final Project Presentation. This contains the project files for submission including the manuscript, presentation, and program.
## Folder Structure

The workspace contains four folders, where:

- `DOCUMENTS`: the folder containing documentation.
- `MANUSCRIPT`: the folder containing the word and pdf file for the project manuscript.
- `LOGO`: the folder containing the client's logo.
- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
